# Toji Zenin Battle Predictor

A machine learning model that predicts how Toji Zenin (the Sorcerer Killer) would fare against major cursed spirits and sorcerers from Jujutsu Kaisen, all at their prime strength.

## Features

- **Comprehensive Character Stats**: All major cursed spirits from Finger Bearers to full-power Sukuna
- **ML-Based Prediction**: Uses Random Forest and Gradient Boosting classifiers
- **Prime Strength Analysis**: Every character at their absolute peak
- **Detailed Battle Breakdowns**: Win probabilities, key factors, and strategic analysis

## Toji's Prime Abilities

- **Heavenly Restriction**: Zero cursed energy but superhuman physical abilities
- **Complete Stealth**: Cannot be sensed by cursed energy detection
- **Master Assassin**: Peak combat IQ and tactical planning
- **Cursed Tool Arsenal**: Inverted Spear of Heaven, Split Soul Katana, Chain of a Thousand Miles, etc.

## Opponents Included

- Finger Bearers
- Dagon (with Domain Expansion)
- Hanami
- Jogo (Volcanic Curse)
- Mahito (Idle Transfiguration)
- Naoya Zenin (Cursed Spirit form)
- Geto Suguru (Prime)
- Gojo Satoru (Prime)

- And more...

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```bash
python predict_toji_battles.py
```

This will:
1. Train the ML model on battle scenarios
2. Generate predictions for all matchups
3. Display detailed analysis for each fight
4. Save the model for future use

## Model Features

The model considers:
- Speed advantages
- Physical strength differentials
- Combat IQ and intelligence
- Domain expansion nullification (Toji's unique advantage)
- Instant-kill techniques
- AOE attacks
- Regeneration abilities
- Size advantages

## Results

The model predicts outcomes based on canonical fights and logical power scaling, accounting for Toji's unique advantages (invisible to cursed energy, domain nullification) and vulnerabilities (no cursed energy defenses).
